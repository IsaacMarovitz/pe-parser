A blazing fast ðŸ”¥ PE Parser written in Rust

## Motivation
The main goals of `pe-parser` is to write something suitable for a PE Loader.

## Is editing supported?
Currently no, but it wouldn't be too difficult to add from the current backbone.

## How does it handle unsual or malformed PEs?
As long as the PE conforms to the standard outlined in Microsoft's documentation, it should read fine. Malformed PEs would likely run into issues of either returning an error or misreading data.
